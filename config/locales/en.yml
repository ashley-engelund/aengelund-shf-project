  # MENUS
  #  This section will mostly parallel the structure of the actual menus.
  #  For submenus:  create a key that represents the submenu, and then the
  #   the first (sub-) entry under that key should be the text displayed for
  #   that submenu. Use the key 'submenu_title:'  (This organization is a little different than the actual
  #   menus; it has the extra key and the title for the submenu is under
  #   the key for the section.)
